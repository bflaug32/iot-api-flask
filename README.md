# fabbit-iot
An end-to-end Internet Of Things (iot) solution for the Fabbit (an Arduino-based hardware development board by Matt Garfield @ https://nextfab.com/) also the MKR-1000 (Arduino's official and expensive wifi development board https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000)

## What's inside? What does 'end-to-end' mean?
* [A Server](./server/README.md) a lightweight server for sending and receiving data to get reports from or control your hardware
* [Hardware](./hardware/README.md) code for some simple sensors or output/display/notification arduino-based stuff that connects to the [the server](./server/README.md)
* Eventually... [Dashboards](./dashboards/README.md) to display your data or control your hardware, in a more beautiful way

## A Guide to "The Stack"
* Source Control: [Git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* Hardware: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)
* Server: [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* Containerization: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/)
* Bash: [bash](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/)
* Web Charts [C3.js](http://c3js.org/)
* Android App: [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html)
